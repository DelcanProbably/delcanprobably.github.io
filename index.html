                    I'm Declan and I'm a game developer and musician. This is a webzone what I made to showcase the games and other cool things I've made.

                    I've always been interested in game development for how it uniquely combines imagination and computer engineering, and I've carried that passion through to my career. In 2023, I graduated my Bachelor of Science in Games Development at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) with distinction.

                        <p>
                            <i>Quantum Loop</i> is a short non-linear space exploration game where you play as a galactic agent sent on a mission across time to solve an existential threat to the universe: the Asteroid Crisis. Explore, dodge, and zoom your way around the quadrant, meeting quirky characters and completing intertwining quests that you're left to solve however you'd like. Exploit everything you can learn about the quadrant to solve the asteroid crisis and save the universe!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've been working on Quantum Loop since January 2024, as an entirely solo passion project. It's built in a custom engine based on PyGame, written entirely in Python. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As well the project advancing my programming skills, I've also been using it as a base to demonstrate everything I've learnt about iterative game design. I've been running regular playtests and using player feedback to inform large-scale changes to the game's core design. While it originally was intended to be a systematic space simulation, it's evolved into a non-linear adventure with a unique time loop mechanic. I've put a big emphasis on player choice and freedom, and players can complete objectives in a multitude of ways that aren't explicitly pointed out. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This will be my first project to ship on Steam! It's been a really fun game to work on and I hope that people love it as much as I do when it releases in 2025!

                            Medieval-themed isometric turn-based-strategy game with unique tactics rethought from the ground-up.

                        <p>
                            We made Gambit in Unity as a team of 6. I primarily worked on programming for gameplay and back-end systems as well as some UI design. The game was originally made for a uni project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through this project, I've learnt a lot about the process of game development, working as a team and dividing tasks. It's also been a platform for great iterative design opportunities as we've constantly looked over the game to find and push for what works, and change what doesn't.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've continued working on the game, and whilst development is slow, we plan to one day release the game independently on PC and mobile!

                            In Heavy Metal, you wield a giant sword and must defeat hoards of foes of many types, each with various defences requiring a different attack strategy. The sword is controlled with the mouse, a unique control method that creates physics-based mayhem. You have three abilities that each support your mobility in different ways - a jump to leap above enemies, a slow-motion speed burst to dodge enemies and help with timing your attacks, and a risky dash move.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project began life as a uni assignment where I played a lead role as both a programmer and designer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was one of the first projects I felt we really effectively approached from a design-first attitude. We started with a very basic prototype of a stick figure with a sword and gradually week-by-week built it out and followed the fun elements based on playtests. That was a really powerful process and this was where I made the most progress as a developer from this project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We're looking into rebuilding Heavy Metal from the ground up as a more arcade-style mobile game, with endless gameplay and a deeper progression system.

                            Project Inertia is a 3D action platformer where you are tasked with zooming through levels to deliver packages as quickly as possible. You are armed with your Surf-Sword, both a defensive weapon and a mode of transportation. You can toggle between two different control methods; on-foot is best for getting through tricky platforming courses with tight jumps, and surfing mode is better for speed and style, inspired by skating games.

                        <p>
                            My contribution was for this project was primarily as a gameplay programmer. As part of this project, we collaborated with music and sound design students, working with them to bring our vision to life and integrating their content into our game through FMOD. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a gameplay programmer on this project I learnt heaps about physics and game feel. We had a lot of obstacles to completing this project so we found ways to adapt our plan while still expressing what we wanted to. I also learnt a lot about team management through this project as we worked with students from a totally different field and learned to effectively communicate what we needed to achieve the vision we had for the project.

                            We made this animation in Unreal Engine 5 by shopping together stock assets available on the Unreal Marketplace and other sources. Through this project we learnt about realtime animation techniques and their potential in the 3D animation space. It also gave me a way to explore storytelling technqiues and start thinking about 3D animation shots similarly to in live action cinema. It also refined my skills in UE5 especially regarding lighting and animation.

                <p id='quack'>
                    <b>Quack</b> (Unreal Engine 4, 2021) - 
                    This is an online multiplayer FPS I made during university to demonstrate a high technical ability in Unreal Engine and game programming. Players compete to score as many kills as possible! It features a procedurally generated arena with randomised weapons. Whilst there's no demo available for this game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNiLmyw2TI">here</a> is a video where I run through the technical side of the level generation system.

                    Noclip is a game I originally made in 2021 during COVID lockdowns as a silly multiplayer game to play with my friends. The concept: a free-for-all FPS where everyone has no-clip. We never actually ended up playing it, but all the same this was my first time making an online multiplayer game. The implementation is a little bodgy and anti-cheat hasn't even been considered, but it supports a listen server for games over the internet using Unity MLAPI back when it was in Beta. I have no idea how balanced it is, but it's hopefully a bit of fun for some crazy multiplayer shenanigans!

                    Way back in my first year of uni, we were tasked to make a remake of Pac-Man, with a bonus 5 marks for adding bonus features. I made a whole mode based on the game SUPERHOT, where you fly around the Pac-Man map shooting the ghosts.

                <p>
                    This is a system I designed for Unity projects to communicate with Raspberry Pi devices over a local network. I created a simple protocol to network a host device to many child devices. I primarily experimented with audio, making physical devices play sounds to reflect gameplay. I also implemented interfacing with GPIO, allowing you to control LEDs and other basic electronics. My intent is that developers can cheaply and easily use off-the-shelf electronics, 3D-printing, etc. to create a novel physical representation of their games. It's theoretically scalable to any engine or device, and almost anything is possible functionality-wise too. I provide instructions on how to add extensions to the package I've developed, however the backend for this isn't particularly elegant.
